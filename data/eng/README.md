## Corpora

### Penn Treebank

The folder *treebank* contains the 10% of the [Penn Treebank] that are distributed with the [NLTK] data set, in particular just the **combined** data set. The annotation with TIE-ML temporal properties and sequencing will be made available there as well, as stand-off annotations, and in TIE-ML XML format. We are potentially looking also into a format that is more compatible with [CoNLL-U].

For details about the licensing conditions and references related to the [Penn Treebank] see the README.txt file in the corpus folder.
