## Introduction

TIE-ML is a markup strategy and annotation schema to improve the productivity and accuracy of temporal and event related annotation of corpora to facilitate machine learning based model training. For the annotation of events, and temporal sequencing and duration of events, it is significantly simpler, and thus easier to use than much more sophisticated formalisms and approaches such as TimeML. Annotations of corpora using TimeML can be mapped to TIE-ML with a loss, and TIE-ML annotations can be fully mapped to TimeML with certain under-specification.
